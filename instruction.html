    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
    <p>You have to draw cards and get as close as you can to 21. 
        If you beat your opponent, who is aiming to do the same, 
        you win that round. If however you get your sum more than
        21 you will lose.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, it's not that easy. One card is obscured from
        view from your opponent, meaning you have to guess what 
        their score is. However, since there are no doubles - 
        there is only one of each card going up to the maximum, 
        11 - you can deduce what they could have based on the 
        cards already in play.
